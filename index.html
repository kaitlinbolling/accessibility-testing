							I'm currently the Director of User Experience Development at Alley, where I have worked for almost 7 years.
						
							Alley is a full-service digital agency that specializes in enterprise level WordPress development.

							While at Alley, we occassionally would have clients ask us how accessible their site is. Maybe they had questions from users, maybe they were trying to improve performance or SEO, or maybe they were just trying to not get sued.
							
							In any case, we realized we didn't have a proper process for evaluating the accessibility of a site. We all had our own individual methods and standards and ideas.

							So, we decided to form a task force to create a guide that all developers could follow. We eventually broke out the audit process into four steaps, and even wrote Jira ticket templates for each step so that teams could easily clone them into their sprints.

							In my talk today I'd like to introduce you to those steps in order to hopefuly inspire and empower you conduct audits on the sites you work on.

							Your goal is to identify and define the requirements needed for the audit. This could include:
							1. Audit Scope
							
							Audits can range from a large detailed report that is very encompassing, or something much more targeted. Knowing the type of audit needed will help shape deliverables and scope. For example, does the whole site need an audit? Many sites? One section of a site? Is there a particular area of the site that needs extra attention?

							After defining the scope, document a list of URLs that will be tested. These pages may include:
							- All unique templates (ex: the homepage, an archive listing page, a post detail page, a content page)
							- High-traffic pages
							- Pages with complex or highly interactive elements, such as videos or forms

							1. Conformance Level
							
							Define WCAG conformance level, and make sure to note version number. WCAG is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, and is the standard for accessibility. The conformance level can be defined as:
							- WCAG A, AA, or AAA.
							- Specify version (WCAG 2.2)
							- https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/

							1. Evaluation Methods and Tools
							
							Define evaluation methods and tools you plan to use, including:
							- Automated testing tools
							- Screen reader software
							- Browsers: Identify any specific browsers and browser versions that may need to be supported.

							1. Note specific device considerations
							
							Sometimes specific devices are used to employ more accessibility oriented software. If specific devices are used, having access to one or being able to reproduce the environment helps testing workflow.
							
							1. Document currently known areas of interest
							
							If there are known challenges or areas of interest, make note for manual and automated testing. You can use more rigorous or manual testing for areas that need specific investigation.
							
							1. Define deliverables and reports
							
							Identify needed deliverables and craft them to the audit and scope. Audits can include a number of documents, such as:
							
							- Overview statement or summary
							- WCAG Conformance Report
							- Design Mockups
							- Specific Remediation Strategies

							Pros:
							- Efficient: Scans hundreds of pages quickly, and scales well for large websites and applications.
							- Integrates easily into CI/CD pipelines for continuous accessibility monitoring
							- Consistent: applies the same rules across your entire digital product which can be measured and tracked over time.
							- Low barrier to entry: many tools are free or low-cost and can be run by people with limited accessibility knowledge
							
							Cons:
							- Only detects about 30-40% of all issues
							- Can't evaluate the quality or appropriateness of accessibility solutions. For example, it can detect if an image has alt text, but not if it's actually meaningful.
							- Struggles with dynamic content and state changes in more complex applications

							I'm sure a lot of you have used Lighthouse to test performance on your site. It's built right into Chrome DevTools which is convenient, and you can also run Lighthouse as part of PageSpeed Insights, from the command line, or as a Node module. 

							Here's a few things to know when using Lighthouse to test for accessibility specifically.
							- The Lighthouse Accessibility score is a weighted average of all accessibility audits.
							- Weighting is based on axe user impact assessments. Axe is a suite of a11y testing tools by deque systems, who is a leading provider of digital accessibility solutions.
							- Each accessibility audit is pass or fail. Unlike the Performance audits, a page doesn't get points for partially passing an accessibility audit. For example, if some buttons on a page have accessible names, but others don't, the page gets a 0 for the Buttons do not have an accessible name audit.

							- Keyboard traps: Are there any places where you can't tab away from an element?
							- Skip links: Are mechanisms available to bypass repetitive navigation? According to the Webaim report, 13.7% of home pages had a "skip" link present. One out of every ten "skip" links were brokenâ€”either they were hidden in a way that made them inaccessible or the link target was not present in the page.
							- Access to all functionality: Can every feature be used without a mouse?
							- Custom widgets: Do complex components (dropdowns, date pickers, etc.) work with keyboard controls?
							- Modal dialogs: Can you properly enter, use, and exit modal windows?
							- Hidden content: Can expandable sections be opened and closed with the keyboard?
							- Focus management: Does focus move appropriately when content changes?
